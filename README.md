First go at creating evolution sim

For this code to work you will need to provide PNG images for mushroom.png, stickman.png and stickwoman.png in the same folder (see zipped file for example).

This model puts a bunch of male and female animals into a pen with food dropped in every few seconds.
Animals get hungry over time and die when their hunger reaches 100.
Animals move, but with a hunger cost which determined by their 'efficiency' trait.
That trait is inherited...
When a female and male animal meet they will mate if they both have efficiency traits high enough to meet their mate's mating standard.
