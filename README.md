First go at creating evolution sim

This model puts a bunch of male and female animals into a pen with food dropped in every few seconds.
Animals get hungry over time and die when their hunger reaches 100.
Animals move, but with a hunger cost which determined by their 'efficiency' trait.
That trait is inherited...
When a female and male animal meet they will mate if they both have efficiency traits high enough to meet their mate's mating standard.
